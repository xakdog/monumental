# Task 05 - Inverse kinematics

## Decisions

- Due to the time constraints, I decided not to implement IK on backend. I will only show off the interface.
- I will make a toggle with icons to switch between direct control and IK mode.

## Future ideas

- It might be cool to display TransformControls for point selection

## Log

- Added panel with icons
- Added a way to display errors globally
- Fooled a user into thinking that feature is broken, if they ever use it they might report us a bug :p
