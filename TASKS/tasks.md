# Tasks

## Requirements

- Backend holding state of a robot, preserved after refresh
- WebGL frontend
  - display the current state
  - ability to control each actuator separately
  - ability to move robot to a specific point in 3d space
- Focus on FE/UX

## High-level tasks

1. Three.js visualization with boxes
2. A mock server + TS tests
3. React/Remix wrapper with state
4. Selecting the actuator and controlling it
5. Inverse kinematics
6. Think trough impossible and error states

Fancy things: 3D model of a robot, look into URDF, make it work with touch/mobile
