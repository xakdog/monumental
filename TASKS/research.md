# Research

Before building my own solution, I want to see what's already out there.

## I have looked into

Gazebo: https://youtu.be/laWn7_cj434
ABB RobotStudio: https://youtu.be/X1AcsGxvgi0
Fanuc ROBOGUIDE: https://youtu.be/neAFHplKu-Y
RoboDK: https://youtu.be/JkjOB8YsJIY

## Findings

* Trackballs: often used to control the rotation of joints
* Gazebo: uses blender-like form controls with a panel on the left
* Layout: all of them have 3D view area + left panel + (windows tool panel)
* Simulation: RoboDK was controlling a physical robot. The rest showed a simulated environment.
* Responsiveness: all of them are built for big screens

## Standards to look into

* Robot Operating System - an open-source robotics middleware
* SDF (Simulation Description Format)
* URDF: can be used to describe robot configuration
